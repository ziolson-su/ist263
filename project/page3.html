        <h1>Tips on Having a Great Trip to New York</h1>

        <p>Make dinner reservations! There are thousands of restaurants in New<br> York, so you won’t have trouble finding somewhere to go out.<br> However, if you are looking to go to a popular restaurant, I would<br> definitely consider making a reservation a few weeks in advance<br> because the tables can pack up really quickly! Also, many<br> restaurants are not that big, so they can only hold so many people.</p>

        <div class="link"><a href="https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/itinerary-templates">Check out how to make an itinerary!</a></div>
        <p>Make an itinerary and prioritize what you want to see and do! There<br> are two types of people on a trip, ones with an itinerary and ones who<br> go with the flow. However, a trip to New York is not like a trip to a<br> tropical island, so you should definitely prioritize what you want to<br> see and plan it out! There are not enough hours in the day to<br> experience all New York has to offer, so make sure to have good time<br> management to be able to go to many sights!</p>

        <p>Try to stay at a convenient location! Depending on your budget, you<br> may stay somewhere not in Manhattan, or a spot far away from<br> many top attractions. However, if you could stay at a good location,<br> do it! The trip will be much more enjoyable if you don’t have to stress<br> about commuting. Also, it would be nice to stop at your hotel during<br> the day for a break if it is not out of the way.</p>

        <p>Consider walking from point A to point B! During busy hours, it's<br> sometimes even faster to walk to your destination as opposed to<br> taking a car or subway. Also, walking from place to place will allow<br> you to see and explore more areas of the city without specifically<br> taking the time to do so. </p>

        <img class="imageright" src="../images/taxi.jpeg" alt="Hailing a cab" width="400" height="200">
        <p>Know how to call a taxi! Public transportation is convenient, walking is<br> great, and applications such as Uber and Lyft make transportation much<br> easier! However, sometimes if you are in a hurry and don’t have much<br> time to wait, a taxi is a great option. To call a taxi in the City, go to the<br> curb and confidently put your arm up while intensely standing looking<br> at the taxis. Make sure not to be standing at certain spots like a bus stop<br> because they are not permitted to pick passengers up there!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
