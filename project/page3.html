        <h1>Tips on Having a Great Trip to New York</h1>
        <p><strong>Make dinner reservations! There are thousands of restaurants in New York, so you won’t have trouble finding somewhere to go out. However, if you are looking to go to a popular restaurant, I would definitely consider making a reservation a few weeks in advance because the tables can pack up really quickly! Also, many restaurants are not that big, so they can only hold so many people.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Make an itinerary and prioritize what you want to see and do! There are two types of people on a trip, ones with an itinerary and ones who go with the flow. However, a trip to New York is not like a trip to a tropical island, so you should definitely prioritize what you want to see and plan it out! There are not enough hours in the day to experience all New York has to offer, so make sure to have good time management to be able to go to many sights!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Try to stay at a convenient location! Depending on your budget, you may stay somewhere not in Manhattan, or a spot far away from many top attractions. However, if you could stay at a good location, do it! The trip will be much more enjoyable if you don’t have to stress about commuting. Also, it would be nice to stop at your hotel during the day for a break if it is not out of the way.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Consider walking from point A to point B! During busy hours, its sometimes even faster to walk to your destination as opposed to taking a car or subway. Also, walking from place to place will allow you to see and explore more areas of the city without specifically taking the time to do so. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>Know how to call a taxi! Public transportation is convenient, walking is great, and applications such as Uber and Lyft make transportation much easier! However, sometimes if you are in a hurry and don’t have much time to wait, a taxi is a great option. To call a taxi in the City, go to the curb and confidently put your arm up while intensely standing looking at the taxis. Make sure not to be standing at certain spots like a bus stop because they are not permitted to pick passengers up there!</strong></p>
