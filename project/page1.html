        <img src="../images/centralpark.jpeg" alt="central park" width="300" height="300">
        <p> <strong>Central Park</strong> <br>
            This park that is centered in Manhattan is great for<br> any day and activities are available for whatever you<br> could be in the mood for! From walking, picnicking,<br> pedicabs, or even just taking in the greenery on a<br> nice sunny day, this is a family friendly spot with a<br> warm and welcoming atmosphere. </p>

            <img src="../images/rockefellercenter.jpeg" alt="rockefeller center" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>Rockefeller Center & Top of the Rock Observation Deck</strong> <br>
                There is no better way to appreciate the NYC landscape then visiting one of the skyscrapers that are a component of the skyline. At the top of the rock observation deck, you can ascend 70 floors above ground level and take in the magnificent 360-view from three different viewing decks. </p>

            <img src="../images/timessquare.jpeg" alt="times square" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>Times Square</strong> <br> 
                When people talk about New York, they say it’s the city that never sleeps. Time Square is a place that stands by that saying as it is one of the most fast and energetic spots in the City. The flashing lights, billboards, and moving crowds are staples of the New York atmosphere. </p>

            <img src="../images/themet.jpeg" alt="Metropolitan Museum of Art" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong> <br>
                New York has some of the best museums in the world. At the Met, you can never spend enough time there. It could take weeks to browse the thousands of years of human creativity. Part of this museum’s theme is to collect, study, save, and then foreshow monumental works of art across all time periods of the world and allow people to connect to these ancient ideas. </p>

            <img src="../images/911memorial.jpeg" alt="National September 11 Memorial and Museum" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>National September 11 Memorial and Museum</strong> <br>
                Everyone was affected by the impacts of 9/11 and the memorial and museum are to help people pay respect for those who lost their lives on that horrific day. The waterfalls are both 30 feet tall and sit at the footprint where the north and south towers once stood. The pools are the largest man-made waterfalls in North America. </p>

            <img src="../images/statueofliberty.jpeg" alt="Statue of Liberty" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong> Statue of Liberty </strong> <br>
                The Statue of Liberty is meaningful to so many people as for millions of immigrants, it was their first sight of America and a symbol of freedom and hope for the future. To visit Liberty Island, you can take the ferry from Battery Park. </p>

            <img src="../images/highline.jpeg" alt="High Line" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>The High Line</strong> <br>
                Which was at one time a railroad track is not a tourist attraction. This elevated walking area serves as a retreat from the fast-paced city. Some refer to it as a “walking park” because of the addition of plants, walkways, picnic tables, areas to sit, and art installations. With pretty views of the Hudson river and the skyline, taking a stroll on the highline is a must!</p>

            <img src="../images/bridge.jpeg" alt="Brooklyn Bridge" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong>Brooklyn Bridge</strong> <br>
                This bridge is definitely the most beautiful in New York and many people love to walk to Brooklyn via one of the city’s most iconic and well-known structures. The walk is around 40 minutes and offers incredible views of lower Manhattan. Taking the walk during sunset hours is even more breathtaking! However, it is indeed a huge tourist attraction, so if you don’t like crowds the Williamsburg Bridge can also offer a similar experience. </p>
