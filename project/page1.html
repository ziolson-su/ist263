        <h2 class="h2">Favorite Destinations</h2>
        <img class="rightimage" src="../images/centralpark.jpeg" alt="central park" width="300" height="300">
        <p> <strong class="strong">Central Park</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
            This park that is centered in Manhattan is great for<br> any day and activities are available for whatever you<br> could be in the mood for! From walking, picnicking,<br> pedicabs, or even just taking in the greenery on a<br> nice sunny day, this is a family friendly spot with a<br> warm and welcoming atmosphere. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/rockefellercenter.jpeg" alt="rockefeller center" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">Top of the Rock Observation Deck</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                There is no better way to appreciate the NYC landscape<br> then visiting one of the skyscrapers that are a<br> component of the skyline. At the top of the rock<br> observation deck, you can ascend 70 floors above<br> ground level and take in the magnificent 360-view from<br> three different viewing decks. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/timessquare.jpeg" alt="times square" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">Times Square</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                When people talk about New York, they say it’s the city that<br> never sleeps. Time Square is a place that<br> stands by that saying as it is one of the most fast and energetic spots in the<br> City. The flashing lights, billboards, and moving crowds are<br> staples of the New York atmosphere. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/themet.jpeg" alt="Metropolitan Museum of Art" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                New York has some of the best museums in the world. At the Met, you<br> can never spend enough time there. It could take weeks to browse the<br> thousands of years of human creativity. Part of this museum’s theme is<br> to collect, study, save, and then foreshow monumental works of art<br> across all time periods of the world and allow people to connect to<br> these ancient ideas. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/911memorial.jpeg" alt="National September 11 Memorial and Museum" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">National September 11 Memorial and Museum</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                Everyone was affected by the impacts of 9/11 and the memorial<br> and museum are to help people pay respect for those who lost<br> their lives on that horrific day. The waterfalls are both 30 feet<br> tall and sit at the footprint where the north and south towers<br> once stood. The pools are the largest man-made waterfalls in<br> North America. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/statueofliberty.jpeg" alt="Statue of Liberty" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong"> Statue of Liberty </strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                The Statue of Liberty is meaningful to so many people as for<br> millions of immigrants, it was their first sight of America and a<br> symbol of freedom and hope for the future. To visit Liberty<br> Island, you can take the ferry from Battery Park. </p> </div>

            <img src="../images/highline.jpeg" alt="High Line" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">The High Line</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                Which was at one time a railroad track is not a tourist<br> attraction. This elevated walking area serves as a retreat<br> from the fast-paced city. Some refer to it as a “walking park”<br> because of the addition of plants, walkways, picnic tables,<br> areas to sit, and art installations. With pretty views of the<br> Hudson river and the skyline, taking a stroll on the highline<br> is a must!</p> </div>

            <img src="../images/bridge.jpeg" alt="Brooklyn Bridge" width="300" height="300">
            <p> <strong class="strong">Brooklyn Bridge</strong> <br> <div class="maintext">
                This bridge is definitely the most beautiful in New York and many<br> people love to walk to Brooklyn via one of the city’s most iconic<br> and well-known structures. The walk is around 40 minutes and<br> offers incredible views of lower Manhattan. Taking the walk during<br> sunset hours is even more breathtaking! However, it is indeed a<br> huge tourist attraction, so if you don’t like crowds the Williamsburg<br> Bridge can also offer a similar experience. </p> </div>
